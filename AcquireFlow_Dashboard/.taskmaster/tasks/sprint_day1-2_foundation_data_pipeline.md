# Sprint Days 1-2: Foundation & Data Pipeline

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Goal
Build the foundation and data pipeline for automated property scraping and agent contact extraction.

## Priority
**CRITICAL - Must Complete**

## Status
Not Started

## Estimated Time
16 hours (2 days)

## Success Metrics
- Clean, organized codebase with consistent styling
- Working scraper pulling 500+ properties with agent contact info
- Agent data extraction with 80%+ accuracy

## Requirements

### 1. Project Structure Cleanup & Organization
- âœ… Reorganize component hierarchy for better maintainability
- âœ… Consolidate duplicate code and components
- âœ… Implement consistent file naming conventions
- âœ… Create shared utility functions and hooks
- âœ… Set up proper TypeScript interfaces for data models

### 2. Design System Implementation
**Color Palette:**
- Primary Green: #77c57f
- Ocean Blue: #4f8fdf  
- Deep Teal: #3b9db0
- Royal Purple: #7c6bdf
- Warm Orange: #ff8b5a
- Bright Yellow: #ffc947
- Coral Pink: #ff7b9d
- Supporting Neutrals: #2d3e50, #64748b, #cbd5e1, #ffffff, #f8fafc

- âœ… Create CSS custom properties for the color system
- âœ… Design consistent button styles with color variations
- âœ… Implement card component with modern styling
- âœ… Create typography scale and spacing system
- âœ… Design form input components

### 3. Listings Scraping Service (Zillow Focus for MVP)
- âœ… Build Node.js scraping service with Puppeteer/Playwright
- âœ… Implement rate limiting and proxy rotation system
- âœ… Create data extraction pipelines for property details
- âœ… Build property deduplication logic
- âœ… Add automated data refresh scheduling
- âœ… Build fallback systems for blocked requests

### 4. Agent Contact Extraction
- âœ… Create intelligent parsing for agent contact blocks
- âœ… Implement phone number standardization and validation
- âœ… Build email extraction with spam filtering
- âœ… Create agent profile deduplication across listings
- âœ… Add agent performance tracking (listings count, price ranges)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All components follow consistent naming patterns and use new color palette
- [ ] Shared components are properly abstracted with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Scraping service pulls 500+ active listings daily
- [ ] Agent contact extraction achieves 80%+ accuracy for name, email, phone
- [ ] Data accuracy rate > 95% with proper normalization
- [ ] Processing time < 5 minutes per batch of 100 listings

## Files to Create/Modify
- `/lib/scraping/` - Property scraping services
- `/lib/agents/` - Agent contact extraction utilities  
- `/components/ui/` - Design system components
- `/styles/` - Color system and design tokens
- `/types/` - TypeScript definitions for listings and agents
- `/lib/utils/` - Shared utility functions

## Dependencies
- Puppeteer or Playwright for scraping
- Database setup for storing listings and agents
- API rate limiting middleware

## Notes
This foundation task is critical for the entire sprint. The scraping service and agent extraction must be reliable and accurate to support the bulk offer system.

## Next Task Dependencies
- Sprint Days 3-4: Advanced Filtering & Selection System depends on this task's completion
