## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Filter interface responds within 2 seconds for 10,000+ properties

- [ ] Filter combinations can be saved and loaded instantly
- [ ] Selection preview accurately calculates totals and averages
- [ ] All filters work independently and in combination
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design for tablet/phone usage

## Files to Create/Modify
- `/app/properties/page.tsx` - Enhanced properties page with filtering
- `/components/properties/FilterSidebar.tsx` - Advanced filter controls
- `/components/properties/PropertyGrid.tsx` - Property listing grid with selection
- `/components/properties/SelectionSummary.tsx` - Selected properties preview
- `/components/properties/PropertyCard.tsx` - Individual property display
- `/hooks/usePropertyFilters.ts` - Filter state management
- `/lib/property-filters.ts` - Filter logic and calculations

## Dependencies

- Property data from scraping service
- Database with property listings

## Notes
This is the core user interaction that will determine adoption success. The filtering must be fast, intuitive, and powerful enough to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Next Task Dependencies
- Sprint Days 5-7: Offer Template & Automation System depends on property selection functionality
