- âœ… Completed - All messages sent successfully
- âœ… Paused - User paused campaign
- âœ… Failed - Campaign encountered critical errors
- âœ… Partial - Some messages failed, needs review

### 4. Error Handling & Retry Mechanisms
**Automated Error Recovery:**
- âœ… Retry failed sends with exponential backoff

- âœ… Error categorization (temporary vs permanent failures)
- âœ… Retry attempt tracking
- âœ… Success rate analytics

### 5. Email Deliverability Optimization
**Technical Setup:**
- âœ… SPF record configuration and validation
- âœ… DKIM signing for email authentication
- âœ… DMARC policy implementation
- âœ… Email warm-up procedures for new domains

- âœ… Subject line A/B testing capability
- âœ… Sender reputation management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Campaign can process 500+ recipients without performance degradation
- [ ] Email delivery rate consistently above 90%
- [ ] SMS delivery rate consistently above 85%
- [ ] Failed sends are automatically retried up to 3 times
- [ ] Real-time progress updates within 30 seconds of actual status
- [ ] System handles multiple concurrent campaigns efficiently
- [ ] Campaign pause/resume functionality works immediately

## Files to Create/Modify
- `/lib/campaigns/` - Campaign management and orchestration
- `/lib/queue/` - Background job processing system
- `/components/campaigns/CampaignDashboard.tsx` - Campaign management UI
- `/components/campaigns/ProgressTracker.tsx` - Real-time progress display
- `/components/campaigns/CampaignForm.tsx` - Campaign creation interface
- `/api/campaigns/` - Campaign API endpoints
- `/lib/delivery/` - Email and SMS delivery optimization
- `/lib/errors/` - Error handling and retry logic

## Dependencies
- Sprint Days 5-7: Offer Templates & Automation System (must be completed)
- Email service configuration and authentication
- SMS service configuration and authentication
- Database for campaign tracking and logging
- Queue system (Redis recommended)

## Technical Requirements
- Background job processing (Bull, Agenda, or similar)
- Redis for queue management and caching
- Database for campaign and delivery tracking
- Real-time updates (WebSockets or Server-Sent Events)
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Notes
This is where the automation magic happens. The system must be reliable enough to handle high-volume sending while maintaining excellent deliverability rates.
