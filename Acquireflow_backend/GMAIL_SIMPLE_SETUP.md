# Simple Gmail SMTP Setup

## Current Issue
Your Gmail app password is not working. Let's fix this step by step.

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Generate a New Gmail App Password

1. **Go to**: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. **Sign in** with: `varunbro2107@gmail.com`
3. **Select app**: Choose "Mail"
4. **Select device**: Choose "Other (Custom name)"
5. **Enter name**: "AcquireFlow"
6. **Click**: "Generate"
7. **Copy the 16-character password** (remove spaces)

### Step 2: Update Your .env File

Make sure your `.env` file has these exact settings:

```bash
# SMTP Configuration (Gmail)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=varunbro2107@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_new_16_character_app_password
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=varunbro2107@gmail.com
SMTP_FROM_NAME=AcquireFlow

# App Configuration
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**Important**: Replace `your_new_16_character_app_password` with the actual password you generated.

### Step 3: Test the Configuration

1. **Restart your backend server**
2. **Test the connection**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/test-email
   ```
3. **Try the forgot password feature**

## Expected Results

âœ… **Gmail SMTP connected successfully!**
